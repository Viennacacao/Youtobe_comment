Here for director Kong Sheng. I'm new to Chinese drama but lately I've enjoyed some of dramas he directed: Nirvana In Fire, Like A Flowing River, The Disguiser, Ode To Joy.

This episode one looks good. Let me dive till the final episode 🤿
This is the 1st dialect drama that i love quite a lot. Story is touching wz bits of humour injected here and there. I didn't quite get it at the beginning but as the plot evolves, it's a roller coaster of entertainment.  Kudos to the veterans for their participation in this meaningful drama.  👏
Thanks for the subtitles.
Thanks for doing the English subtitles that allow me to show this to my child.
In praise gratitude and compassion

I'm hoping that they will air Mining Town with English subtitles.  Please add English subtitles.
The way I burst out in to tears seeing Shui Hua carrying her husband and daughter with determination and knowing just how much difficulty she had to endure. And her seeing Ma Defu after all these years?!? 🥹🥹🥹
Shuihua is so strong. Walking seven days and nights to the new village while carrying (?) her disabled husband and kid. Insane. 

And when she said she didn't know she's important... so sad 😭
Shui Hua makes me cry third time already. What a woman, and her smile! Brighter than sun. Actress is amazing, everyone here done the great job!
THANK YOU FOR THE SUBS!!! Omggg 😭 💜 ❤️ I can finally watch!! Woohoo :) I love this drama, there’s something so authentic about it.
If you can please put english subtitles as the 2 first episodes.
Why stop updating with English subtitles after episode 2? My foreign friends want to watch too! Pleaseeee!! Thanks
Will the rest of the episodes be given English subtitles?
Good drama

Can't blame the villagers who doubt about the mushroom project. They've been through such hardship, living a tough life. So, sometimes it's better to see their leaders do the project and see if it works.
I love all these characters so so much. 🥹😭❤️‍🔥
Excellent drama !
Im waiting
honest show,  truly reflect the real life of common people

2:41 When Mr. Chen realized he wanted to be in the photo with the villagers too. 😭

Right when I saw his expression, I knew that was what he wanted too. 😭❤️

Also, Uncle Dayou is so despicable. I understand the villagers sentiment of not wanting to lose all their mushrooms and not being able to sell them at high prices, but his selfishness is infuriating. He never takes responsibility for his own actions and blames everyone but himself and then tries to incite everyone else. He reminds me of my own dad. 🫥
I'm Brazilian and I recently started to see some Chinese productions, and this one touched me a lot. Congratulations.
Thank you for putting this drama on youtube. Its one of the best things i have seen in a while!
25:38 Whenever I watch a Chinese drama and they put food that looking good - delicious on the table, I start starving.
Professor Ling is a hero.

Teacher Bai can't even buy a new glasses for himself and his daughter casually says he's selfish. Sad.
Maimiao cannot see the big picture, her dad's action is for the greater good. Bai has been told to get his school to participate in the singing competition. Though the village is impoverished, no funds provided to make uniforms for the event. How else to participate?
She only thinks of herself, how she will be affected by the sale of computers.  She has not done well or enough - can't even do a simple act like informing her dad in advance of her coming home. Or bringing gifts for him since she is visiting. The computers donated to the school but no training on how to use them, as good as useless.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1:45 Song Yunhui has double job to build his country. I wonder if he ever takes a week for holiday because Dongha will collapse without him. Now he has to rescue Minning Town 😂 

Wang Kai, you've worked so hard to reach your level today. Salute.
